Absolutely, for Level 10, let's push the boundaries of metaprogramming further:

### Level 10: Custom Code Analysis and Optimization

**Problem Statement:**
Create a macro-driven optimization system that inspects and optimizes Elixir code by detecting patterns and replacing them with more efficient equivalents. Build a macro that identifies repetitive patterns within the code and transforms them into optimized versions.

For instance, consider the following code snippet that computes the sum of squares for a list of numbers:
```elixir
sum_of_squares = Enum.reduce(numbers, 0, fn x, acc -> acc + x * x end)
