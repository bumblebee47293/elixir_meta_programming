Absolutely! At the base level, let's start with something fundamental for metaprogramming in Elixir: 

### Level 1: Dynamic Function Calling

**Problem Statement:** 
Create a simple Elixir module that contains a few predefined functions. Write a function `call_function` that takes the name of a function as a parameter and dynamically calls that function within the module.

For instance, consider a module named `MathOperations` that contains functions like `add(a, b)`, `subtract(a, b)`, `multiply(a, b)`, and `divide(a, b)`. Your task is to write a function `call_function` that, when given the name of one of these functions as an atom (`:add`, `:subtract`, etc.), can dynamically call the respective function with provided arguments.

This exercise will help you understand how to use metaprogramming techniques like `apply/3` or using macros to dynamically invoke functions based on given inputs.

Give it a try, and when you're ready or if you have any questions, feel free to share your solution or ask for further guidance!
