Certainly, for Level 6, let's explore deeper metaprogramming concepts:

### Level 6: Implement a Custom `with` Macro

**Problem Statement:**
Create a custom `with`-like macro that operates similarly to Elixir's `with` but with additional functionality. Your macro should not only handle pattern matching and error handling but also log or capture the steps performed within each clause.

For instance, the macro should allow the following usage:
```elixir
my_with do
  {:ok, user} <- fetch_user(id)
  {:ok, posts} <- fetch_posts(user)
do
  # Your logic here
end
