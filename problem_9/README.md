For Level 9, let's explore more intricate metaprogramming involving code generation and composition:

### Level 9: Custom Code Composition with Macros

**Problem Statement:**
Develop a macro-driven system that enables composition of functions based on a set of rules. Create a DSL that allows users to define rules specifying how functions should be composed.

For instance:
```elixir
compose_functions do
  rule :rule1, fn arg -> arg + 1 end
  rule :rule2, fn arg -> arg * 2 end
  rule :rule3, fn arg -> "Result: #{arg}" end

  compose :my_composed_function, [:rule1, :rule2, :rule3]
end
